# Lost

Being tired of seeing broken hyperlinks I've decided to do something to help fight the problem. The idea is simple - to have a command line utility to check your site for broken URLs. It should be pretty easy to incorporate into your build to report problematic hyperlinks early.

## Rust

Secondary goal of Lost for me personally is to learn Rust properly in a useful small real world project. Code review, suggestions, PRs and issues are very welcomed.
